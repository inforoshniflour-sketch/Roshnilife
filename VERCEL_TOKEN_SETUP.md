# Vercel Token Authentication Setup

## Step 1: Generate Your Vercel Token

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. **Click:** "Create Token"
3. **Name it:** "ROSHNI Deployment" (or any name you like)
4. **Scope:** Select your team `sabirs-projects-29265fa2`
5. **Expiration:** Choose "No Expiration" or set a date
6. **Click:** "Create Token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** - You'll only see it once!

## Step 2: Share the Token

**Paste your token here in the chat** and I'll use it to deploy your website to your specific team.

The token will look something like:
```
vercel_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Step 3: I'll Deploy

Once you share the token, I'll run:
```bash
vercel --token YOUR_TOKEN --scope sabirs-projects-29265fa2 --yes
```

This will deploy your ROSHNI website directly to your team!

## Security Note
